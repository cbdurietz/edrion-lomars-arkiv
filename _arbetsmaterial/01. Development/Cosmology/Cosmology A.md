# The Aurelis–Redorn System  
## World-Building Reference Document

A physically grounded binary star system designed for narrative depth, astronomical plausibility, and long-term orbital stability.

# I. The Stellar Architecture

## Aurelis — The Hearth Star

- **Type:** G2V Main Sequence Star  
- **Mass:** 1.0 M☉  
- **Luminosity:** 1.0 L☉  
- **Color:** Warm white-gold  
- **Role in Myth:** The Great Flame / The First Light / The Ever-Burning One  

Aurelis is the gravitational and cultural center of the inhabited system. All major planets orbit it directly.

---

## Redorn — The Distant Ember

- **Type:** M3V Red Dwarf  
- **Mass:** 0.4 M☉  
- **Luminosity:** ~2% of Aurelis  
- **Binary Separation:** 30 AU  
- **Orbital Period Around Barycenter:** ~165 years  
- **Cultural Role:** The Watcher / The Red Wanderer / The Second Sun  

Redorn appears as a deep red star in Doria’s sky. Over decades, its slow movement becomes noticeable to astronomers and long-lived cultures.

It does **not** significantly affect planetary climates but influences long-period objects.

# II. The Circumprimary Planetary System

All major planets orbit **Aurelis** in stable S-type orbits.

---

## 1. Thraxis — The Ash World

- **Orbit:** 0.6 AU  
- **Mass:** 0.4 M⊕  
- **Type:** Airless rocky world  
- **Role in Myth:** The Burnt Brother  

A scorched, tidally stressed inner world. No atmosphere. A reminder of what proximity to Aurelis can mean.

---

## 2. Varun — The Veiled Furnace

- **Orbit:** 1.2 AU  
- **Mass:** 0.85 M⊕  
- **Type:** Dense greenhouse world  
- **Role in Myth:** The Hidden Flame  

Thick clouds conceal a superheated surface. Sometimes visible as a brilliant morning or evening star.

---

# III. The Twin Worlds

## 3. Doria — The Living World

- **Orbit:** 1.8 AU  
- **Mass:** 1.0 M⊕  
- **Climate:** Temperate  
- **Surface:** Oceans, continents, seasons  

The primary inhabited world. A near-Earth analog.

### Cultural Themes
- Redorn marks generations.
- The Traveler marks eras.
- Xyphar is both sibling and rival.

---

## 4. Xyphar — The Green Sister

- **Orbit:** 1.82 AU  
- **Mass:** 1.2 M⊕  
- **Climate:** Warmer, humid, cloud-rich  

Often visible from Doria as a bright wandering world. Its near-co-orbital dance with Doria creates complex calendrical systems.

### Cultural Interpretations
- Twin soul  
- Mirror world  
- Rival civilization (speculative fiction potential)

---

# IV. The Outer Giants

## 5. Drakis — The Ice Lord

- **Orbit:** 4.2 AU  
- **Mass:** 14 M⊕  
- **Type:** Ice giant  
- **Moons:** Likely numerous  

Acts as a gravitational shepherd for inner debris.

---

## 6. Keveron — The Great Guardian

- **Orbit:** 6.8 AU  
- **Mass:** 318 M⊕  
- **Type:** Gas giant  
- **Role:** System stabilizer  

The largest planet in the system. Protects inner worlds from many cometary impacts.

---

# V. The Traveler

## Classification
Large long-period comet / dwarf-planet-scale icy body.

## Orbital Characteristics

- **Orbital Parent:** Barycenter  
- **Pericenter:** 1.5–2 AU  
- **Apocenter:** 60–80 AU  
- **Eccentricity:** ~0.95  
- **Inclination:** 50–60°  
- **Period:** 70–100 years  

---

## Physical Nature

- Diameter: 30–80 km  
- Composition: Water ice, methane, ammonia, silicates  
- Develops a bright tail near Aurelis  

---

## Observational Cycle from Doria

1. Faint outer-system object  
2. Rapid brightening over months  
3. Brilliant comet with tail  
4. Crosses inner planetary plane  
5. Fades into deep space  

It becomes visible for several years, then vanishes for generations.

---

## Cultural Significance

Common interpretations include:

- Harbinger of change  
- Cycle marker  
- Era-divider  
- Divine messenger  
- Cosmic exile  

Its predictability (70–100 year cycle) allows advanced cultures to forecast its return.

# VI. System Stability Summary

- Wide binary prevents destabilization of inner system  
- All massive planets orbit Aurelis  
- No massive planets near Redorn’s orbit  
- Inclinations distributed to avoid resonance stacking  
- The Traveler’s low mass prevents planetary perturbation  

The system is dynamically stable on multi-million-year timescales.

---

# VII. Visual Sky from Doria

### Daytime
- Aurelis dominates.

### Night Sky
- Xyphar shines brightly.
- Redorn glows deep red, slowly shifting position over decades.
- The Traveler appears once per lifetime for most citizens.

---

# VIII. Narrative Hooks

- Ancient prophecy tied to The Traveler’s return.
- Astronomers predict orbital shift.
- Redorn enters a brighter phase.
- A civilization on Xyphar tracks the comet differently.
- A moon of Keveron may harbor subsurface life.

---

# IX. Cosmological Themes

- Duality (Aurelis / Redorn)
- Twin worlds (Doria / Xyphar)
- Stability vs. wandering (Planets / Traveler)
- Cycles longer than human lifetimes

This system balances astrophysical realism with mythic resonance — a stable hearth surrounded by a slow celestial clock and a wandering omen.
